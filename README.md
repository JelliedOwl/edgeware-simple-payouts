# edgeware-simple-payouts
A simple script for claiming stacking rewards


This version works some of the time, at least on Beresheet.  

Noting that the wallet claiming the payout doesn't need to benefit from it, definitely only use it with a claim wallet containing a small amount of EDG that you are happy to risk burning.
